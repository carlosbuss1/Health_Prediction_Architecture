- Genomic data, through polygenic risk scores (PRS), provides insights into inherited predispositions for digestive disease
-  like Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, and IBD.  
- PRS helps assess the cumulative impact of multiple genetic variants on disease risk.  

**Key Steps**:  
- **Quality Control**: Use FastQC to assess raw sequencing reads.  
- **Alignment**: Use BWA or Bowtie2 to map reads to a reference genome.

- **PRS Calculation**: Combine GWAS summary statistics with patient VCF files to compute risk scores.  
- **Disease Risk Interpretation**: Categorize risk into Low (Healthy), Borderline, or High (Suggestive of Disease) based on thresholds
-  derived from population studies.  

**Outputs**:  
- Genomic Risk Index for digestive disease predispositions.  
- Categorized health risk levels for personalized recommendations.  

---

**Blood Biomarkers Pipeline**  

**Blood Biomarkers Data**  
- Blood biomarkers provide critical real-time insights into systemic inflammation, nutritional deficiencies, and gut health status.  
- Biomarkers like CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 are essential for assessing inflammatory conditions, while vitamins (D, B12, Folate) indicate
- nutritional status relevant to gut function.  

**Key Steps**:  
- **Nutrient Analysis**: Measure Vitamin D, B12, and Folate using diagnostic assays.  
- **Inflammatory Markers**: Quantify CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and Calprotectin using mass spectrometry.  
- **Normalization**: Apply Z-scores or Min-Max scaling for data standardization.  

**Outputs**:  
- Composite blood biomarker index indicating inflammation and nutritional deficiencies.  
- Categorized levels for interpretation: Low (Healthy), Intermediate (Borderline), or High (Suggestive of Disease).

      -  and functional pathway activity.  
   - **Genomic Risk Index**:  
      - Aggregates PRS scores with external disease progression data.  
   - **Blood Biomarker Index**:  
      - Weighted combination of inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-α, IL-6) and nutrient levels.  
- **Interaction Terms**:  
   - Explore relationships between indices (e.g., microbiome-genomics and microbiome-biomarker interactions) to capture
   - combined effects on health outcomes.  

**Outputs**:  
- Comprehensive dataset ready for predictive modeling.

   - **Approach**:  
      - **Random Forest**: For interpretability, identifying key features (e.g., CRP levels) driving predictions.  
      - **XGBoost**: For handling imbalanced datasets and producing high-performing models with optimized hyperparameters.  
      - **Neural Networks**: For identifying complex, non-linear relationships, particularly for high-dimensional data.  
- **Evaluation**:  
   - **Metrics**:  
      - **Precision**: Minimizes false-positive supplement recommendations.  
      - **Recall**: Captures critical recommendations, avoiding false negatives.  
      - **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall for multi-label predictions.  
      - **Confusion Matrix**: Identifies underperformance or bias in recommendations.

---

### **4. Personalized Recommendation Engine**  

**Purpose**:  
- Generate tailored therapeutic recommendations using ML predictions and clinical rules.  

**Key Steps**:  
- **Rule-Based + ML System**:  
   - Combine predefined clinical rules (e.g., Low F. prausnitzii = Prebiotic) with ML predictions to enhance reliability.  
   - **Example**:  
      - High CRP = Omega-3 supplementation.  
      - ML adds Curcumin if TNF-α is also elevated.  
- **Dynamic Feedback**:  
   - Integrate post-intervention data (e.g., reduced inflammation) to refine future recommendations using reinforcement learning.

### Deliverable 2: Detailed Explanation

#### **1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing Layer**:
   - **Genomics Pipeline**:
     - **Assumption**:
       - Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) from genomic data provide insights into inherited predispositions for
       - cardiovascular conditions such a coronary artery disease and hypertension.
       - Genomic analysis enables personalized risk stratification and preventive measures.
     - **Key Steps**:
       - **Quality Control**: Assess raw genomic data using FastQC.
       - **Alignment**: Map reads to the reference genome using BWA or Bowtie2.
       - **Variant Calling**: Detect SNPs and indels using GATK.
       - **PRS Calculation**: Use GWAS catalog data to compute polygenic risk scores.
       - **Risk Interpretation**: Categorize risk levels as Low (Healthy), Borderline, or High (Suggestive of Disease).
     - **Outputs**:
       - Genomic Risk Index providing a quantified measure of cardiovascular risk.

   - **Blood Biomarkers Pipeline**:
     - **Why Blood Biomarkers?**
       - Cardiovascular diseases are strongly associated with systemic markers such as hsCRP, LDL, HDL, Troponin, and NT-proBNP.
       - Nutrient markers (e.g., Vitamin D) also correlate with cardiovascular health and outcomes.
     - **Key Steps**:
       - Measure protein markers using ELISA or mass spectrometry.
       - Quantify nutrient levels via diagnostic assays.
       - Normalize data using Z-scores and Min-Max scaling.
     - **Outputs**:
       - Composite Cardiovascular Biomarker Index indicating systemic inflammation, lipid levels, and nutrient deficiencies.

#### **2. Feature Engineering Layer**:
   - Normalize indices for comparability across datasets.
   - Combine genomic and biomarker data into composite indices:
     - **Genomic Risk Index**: Aggregates PRS data and external progression data.
     - **Cardiovascular Biomarker Index**: Weighted combination of hsCRP, LDL, HDL, NT-proBNP, and key nutrients.
   - Include interaction terms to explore relationships (e.g., hsCRP and PRS interactions).
   - Outputs a unified dataset for predictive modeling.

#### **3. Predictive Modeling Layer**:
   - Use machine learning to assess cardiovascular risk:
     - **Models**:
       - Random Forest for interpretability.
       - XGBoost for performance and handling imbalanced datasets.
       - Neural Networks for capturing complex patterns.
     - **Metrics**:
       - Precision, Recall, and F1-score ensure balanced evaluations.
       - Confusion matrices analyze errors for therapy categories.
     - **Outputs**:
       - Risk levels categorized as Low, Intermediate, or High.
       - Confidence scores for each therapy recommendation.

#### **4. Personalized Recommendation Engine**:
   - Combine clinical rules with ML predictions for therapy suggestions:
     - High LDL: Statin Therapy.
     - Elevated hsCRP: Omega-3 or anti-inflammatory therapies.
     - Low Vitamin D: Supplementation.
     - High NT-proBNP: Advanced cardiovascular screening.
   - Dynamic feedback refines future recommendations.

#### **5. Security and Scalability**:
     - Role-based access and encryption ensure data safety.
     - Cloud-based architecture supports growth in users and datasets.
